# Learning_grinds
This is an documentary type repo. I created this to start from the beginning and keep every detailed for further. Also putting a documentation for sharing.
This is a whole path way to prepare myself. I will try to keep everything from the begining and learn as much i can.

This is first program that you write in every language. So, here it is the Hello world program.

Code:

//Starts here
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello from the cyborg!");
    }
}
//end of hello world program 

Description: As if many of you face problem to run code and find errors the first line public class Main (Main) is also the file name. Please be careful for choosing the main program name as it gives an error to run if it is not the same as the file name or the program name. The second line describes the printing line for any of your given Strings. So, here "Hello from the cyborg!" will be printed.
